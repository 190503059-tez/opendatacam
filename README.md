# OpenDataCam 3.0.0-beta.3 ‚Äì An open source tool to quantify the world

OpenDataCam is an open source tool to quantify the world. It quantifies and tracks moving objects with live video analysis. It is designed to be an accessible, affordable and open-source solution to better understand interactions in urban environments. 

OpenDataCam never records any photo or video data. The system only saves surveyed meta-data, in particular the path an object moved or number of counted objects at a certain point. The novelty of OpenDataCam is, that everything happens on location, while no visual data is saved or sent to online cloud processing.

OpenDataCam runs on Linux and CUDA GPU enabled hardware. It is optimized for the NVIDIA Jetson Board series. The most affordable setup runs on a Jetson Nano (low cost, credit-card sized GPU-computer) combined with other other off-the-shelf equipment (webcam, power supply, housing), this entire setup is priced around $150. All software is based on open source components and runs completely locally. The software features a friendly user interface and is currently optimised for detecting and counting traffic participants, but is not limited to that. 

Both software and hardware setup are documented and offered as an open source project, to underline transparency and full disclosure on privacy questions. The simple OpenDataCam setup allows everybody to become an urban data miner.

OpenDataCam is very alpha and we do not provide any guarantee that this will work for your use case, but we conceived it as a starting point from where you can build-on & improve.

OpenDataCam is generously supported by [move lab](https://www.move-lab.com/) (ongoing). OpenDataCam was supported in part by a [residency](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/people/benedikt-gros) at the Frank-Ratchye [STUDIO for Creative Inquiry](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University.

## üíª Hardware pre-requisite

- Nvidia Jetson Nano / Xavier NX / Xavier or any GNU/Linux x86_64 machine with a CUDA compatible GPU (Nvidia)
- Webcam Logitech C222, C270, C310, C920 / Rasberry Pi cam for Jetson nano / a Video file / IP camera
- A smartphone / tablet / laptop that you will use to operate the system

## üé¨ Get Started, quick setup

_For Jetson Nano, [you can follow this dedicated quick start guide](documentation/jetson/JETSON_NANO.md)_

### 1. Software pre-requisite üì¶

#### For Jetson: Flash Jetson board to jetpack 4.3 ‚ö°Ô∏è

- [Jetpack 4.3](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) : [How to find out your jetpack version](documentation/jetson/FLASH_JETSON.md#How-to-find-out-my-Jetpack-version), [Guide to flash your jetson](documentation/jetson/FLASH_JETSON.md)

- [Docker compose](https://blog.hypriot.com/post/nvidia-jetson-nano-install-docker-compose/) (no official installer available for ARM64 devices)

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip

sudo apt-get install -y libffi-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python-openssl
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

sudo pip3 install docker-compose
```


#### For Desktop machine: Nvidia container toolkit üîß

- [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)  
- [Docker compose installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Nvidia drivers installed](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (you don't need all CUDA but we didn't found a easy install process for only the drivers)
- [Nvidia Container toolkit installed](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)


For desktop there is a workaround to add with docker-compose to give access to the nvidia runtime. At the time of writing this documentation, GPUs for docker-compose aren't well supported yet, see [https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6691](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6691)

- Open the daemon.json

```
sudo vim /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

- Copy this inside and save the file

```json
{
    "runtimes": {
        "nvidia": {
            "path": "/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime",
            "runtimeArgs": []
        }
    }
}
```

- Restart docker

```
systemctl restart docker
```

You also need to install `nvidia-container-runtime`

```
sudo apt install nvidia-container-runtime
```

### 2. Install and start OpenDataCam üöÄ

Open a terminal or ssh to you machine and run the following commands depending on your platform.

The install script will download a `docker-compose.yml` file and setup a default `config.json` depending on your platform.

_Make sure you have previously installed `docker-compose` by running `docker-compose --version`_


__Install commands:__

```bash
# Download install script
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/v3.0.0-beta.3/docker/install-opendatacam.sh

# Give exec permission
chmod 777 install-opendatacam.sh

# NB: You will be asked for sudo password when installing the docker container
# You might want to stop all docker container running before starting OpenDataCam
# sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -aq)

# Install command for Jetson Nano
# NB: Will run from demo file, you can change this after install, see "5. Customize OpenDataCam"
./install-opendatacam.sh --platform nano

# Install command for Jetson TX2
# Docker build for Jetson TX2 isn't available please install without docker (see in avanced use)

# Install command for Jetson Xavier
# NB: Will run from demo file, you can change this after install, see "5. Customize OpenDataCam"
./install-opendatacam.sh --platform xavier

# Install command for a Desktop machine
# NB: Will run from demo file, you can change this after install, see "5. Customize OpenDataCam"
./install-opendatacam.sh --platform desktop
```

This command will download and start a docker container on the machine. After it finishes the docker container starts a webserver on port 8080 (ports 8070 and 8090 are also used).

The docker container is started in auto-restart mode, so if you reboot your machine it will automaticaly start opendatacam on startup. ([Learn more about the specificities of docker on jetson](#6-docker-playbook-))

You can also [use opendatacam without docker](#how-to-use-opendatacam-without-docker)

### 2. bis (optional) Upgrade OpenDataCam

- If you have modified the `config.json`, save it somewhere
- Remove `config.json`, `docker-compose.yml`
- Run the install steps again (previous section), this will download a new default `config.json` file compatible with the opendatacam version you are installing and setup a new docker container
- Open the newly downloaded config.json script and modify with the things you had changed previously

_NB: we do not handle auto update of the config.json file_

### 3. Use OpenDataCam üññ

Open your browser at http://IPOFJETSON:8080 .

*If you are running with the jetson connected to a screen: http://localhost:8080*

_NB: OpenDataCam only supports one client at a time, if you open the UI on two different devices, the stream will stop in one of them._

See [Docker playbook Ô∏èüìö](#6-docker-playbook-Ô∏è) how to restart / stop OpenDataCam.

### 4. Configure your Wifi hotspot üì≤

In order to operate opendatacam from your phone / tablet / computer.

See [Make jetson device / machine accessible via WIFI](documentation/WIFI_HOTSPOT_SETUP.md)

### 5. Customize OpenDataCam Ô∏èÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è

We offer several customization options:

- **Video input:** run from a file, change webcam resolution, change camera type (raspberry cam, usb cam...)

- **Neural network:** change YOLO weights files depending on your hardware capacity, desired FPS (tinyYOLO, full yolov3, yolov3-openimages ...)

- **Change display classes:** We default to mobility classes (car, bus, person...), but you can change this

[Learn how to customize OpenDataCam](documentation/CONFIG.md)

### 6. Docker playbook Ô∏èüìö

**How to show OpenDataCam logs**

```bash
# Go to the directory you ran install script (where is your docker-compose.yml file)

# List containers
sudo docker-compose logs
```

**How to  stop / restart OpenDataCam**

```bash
# Go to the directory you ran install script (where is your docker-compose.yml file)

# Stop container
sudo docker-compose down

# Stop all docker container
sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -aq)

# If docker (and opendatacam) doesn't start at startup enable it
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Start container
# detached mode
sudo docker-compose up -d
# interactive mode
sudo docker-compose up

# Restart container (after modifying the config.json file for example)
sudo docker-compose restart

# Install a newer version of opendatacam
# Follow the 1. Install and start OpenDataCam

# See stats ( CPU , memory usage ...)
sudo docker stats opendatacam

# Clear all docker container, images ...
sudo docker system prune -a

# Restart docker
sudo service docker restart
```

### How to create / update the docker image

We host our docker images on [Dockerhub](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/opendatacam/opendatacam)

*For jetson devices:*

See [How to create / update a docker image for a jetson device](documentation/jetson/CREATE_DOCKER_IMAGE_JETSON.md)

*For nvidia-docker machine:*

See [How to create / update a docker image for a nvidia-docker machine](documentation/CREATE_DOCKER_IMAGE_DESKTOP.md)


## üéØ How accurate is OpenDataCam ?

Accuracy depends on which YOLO weights your hardware is capable of running.

We are working on [adding a benchmark](https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/issues/87) to rank OpenDataCam on the [MOT Challenge (Multiple Object Tracking Benchmark)](https://motchallenge.net/)

## üö§ How fast is OpenDataCam ?

FPS depends on:

- which hardware your are running OpenDataCam on
- which YOLO weights you are using

We made the default settings to run at least at 10 FPS on any Jetson.

Learn more in the [Customize OpenDataCam documentation](documentation/CONFIG.md#Change-neural-network-weights)
